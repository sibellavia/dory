# Auto-append on init

## Decision

When `dory init` runs, automatically append dory usage instructions to CLAUDE.md and/or AGENTS.md if they exist.

## Behavior

- Checks both files (not all users use Claude Code)
- Idempotent - won't duplicate if instructions already present
- No prompt - just does it if file exists

## Rationale

Tighter integration with existing agent instruction files reduces friction for adoption.
